# 🧮 Python Mini Projects

A collection of simple, beginner-friendly Python programs built to strengthen basic programming and logical thinking skills.  
Each script runs independently in the terminal and demonstrates user input handling, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.

## 📘 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Simple Calculator
**File:** `Simple Calculator.py`  

A basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations between two numbers.

**Features**
- Supports addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), division (÷), and modulus (%)
- Handles invalid operator inputs gracefully
- Demonstrates `if-elif-else` logic and user interaction

**Sample Run**
Enter Number 1: 15
Enter Number 2: 5
Enter Operator[+,-,/,*,%]: *
Multiplication of Number 1 & Number 2 is = 75

### 2️⃣ Grade Calculator
**File:** `Grade Calculator.py`  

Calculates a student’s grade based on marks entered by the user.

**Features**
- Uses conditional ranges to assign grades (A, B, C, D, Fail)
- Demonstrates logical operators and decision-making in Python

**Grading Scale**
| Marks Range | Grade |
|--------------|--------|
| 85 – 100 | A |
| 60 – 84 | B |
| 40 – 59 | C |
| 30 – 39 | D |
| Below 30 | Fail |

**Sample Run**
Enter your marks: 72
You scored Grade B

### 3️⃣ BMI Calculator
**File:** `BMI Calculator.py`  

Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using user-provided weight and height.

**Formula**
BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) × Height (m))

**Features**
- Demonstrates user input, mathematical computation, and formatted output
- Provides a practical, real-world use case for Python arithmetic operations

**Sample Run**

Enter your Weight: 65
Enter your Height: 1.75
Your BMI is: 21.22
